# openjev-sglang

A server implementing the [TypeSafe/Jev HTTP API](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api)
with **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B on SGLang**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wHM3jxV.gif)

Each container one B200 with SGLang **0.5.19's Rust frontend**,
radix caching, and **breakable prefill CUDA graphs**. A separate Python API process
uses FastAPI, uvloop, the Rust-backed HF tokenizer, and pooled asynchronous HTTP
connections to SGLang on localhost. CUDA dependencies stay in SGLang's container;
`uv sync` on your laptop installs only the API, deployment tools, and tests.

## Run on Modal

```sh
uv sync
# Only if you haven't authenticated Modal on this machine:
uv run modal setup

# Start a temporary Server, run actual inference checks, then shut it down:
uv run modal run modal_app.py

# Deploy a stable, proxy-authenticated endpoint:
uv run modal deploy modal_app.py
```

The deployment prints a `https://...us-west.modal.direct` URL. It uses a
[Modal Server](https://modal.com/docs/guide/servers), Modal Proxy Token authentication,
`routing_region="us-west"`, and `compute_region=["us-west", "us-central", "us"]`.
Autoscaling is capped at one container and scales to zero after at most one idle minute.
Unauthorized requests are rejected by Modal before they can wake a GPU container.
Set `min_containers=1` in `modal_app.py` to keep a B200 warm.
If SGLang exits unexpectedly, the API exits too. The Modal launcher watches the
API and exits the container so Modal can replace it, rather than leaving a live
HTTP process with a dead inference backend. Normal shutdown disarms both watchers.

Cache warmups also request one unused token probability to avoid SGLang's
[mixed-logprob batch crash](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/34719).
This keeps warmups and scoring requests batch-compatible without patching SGLang.

The first build imports a large SGLang image. The first GPU start also downloads
weights and compiles/captures kernels. Model weights persist in the
`openjev-huggingface` Modal Volume, alongside SGLang's tuning cache and Triton
compilation cache. Later starts reuse these files; CUDA graph capture still runs
at startup. The Rust frontend receives an explicit local tokenizer directory to
avoid remote-name lookup issues with revision-pinned snapshots.
A scaled-to-zero Server returns **503** while it starts; the included smoke command
retries startup responses. Create a workspace Proxy Token, then expose its combined
`wk-....ws-...` value to the client without committing it:

```sh
uv run modal workspace proxy-tokens create
export MODAL_PROXY_TOKEN="wk-....ws-..."
uv run openjev smoke https://YOUR-SERVER.us-west.modal.direct
```

The smoke test covers all three answer types, a 64-answer question, basic semantic
sanity checks, and rejection of 65 answers. It reports startup wait, inference
latency, and cache usage. `modal run` saves this report as `smoke-result.json`.

## Request

```sh
curl "$OPENJEV_URL/v1/systemone" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MODAL_PROXY_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "jev-latest",
    "state": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a support assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "I was charged twice. Please refund the duplicate."}
    ],
    "questions": {
      "refund": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user request a refund?"
      },
      "department": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which department should handle this?",
        "criteria": {"billing": "Payments and refunds", "technical": "Software bugs"}
      },
      "urgency": {
        "type": "score",
        "instructions": "How urgent is the request?",
        "criteria": ["Routine", "Urgent", "Emergency"]
      }
    }
  }'
```

Or use `curl "$OPENJEV_URL/v1/systemone" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @examples/request.json`.

`state`, `instructions`, and criteria descriptions accept strings, JSON objects, or
arrays. Criteria descriptions may also be `null`, in which case the option label is
shown to the model. Structured criteria are serialized as compact JSON. A state that
is a list of chat messages, or exactly `{"messages": [...]}`, is rendered using the
model's native chat template. Original roles and message objects are retained; the
classification question becomes an additional user turn, even after another user
turn. Other structured state is serialized intact into a user message. Objects
containing `messages` plus additional fields are kept intact so metadata isn't
silently discarded. Chat state supports text, not image/audio/video content.

`jev-latest` is a compatibility alias for the configured Qwen model. The public
model ID is `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`;
NVIDIA's repository is only the internal weight source. Set
`OPENJEV_SERVED_MODEL_NAME` or `openjev serve --served-model-name NAME` to override
the public ID. It is also passed to SGLang as `--served-model-name`.
No requests go to TypeSafe. The public server is
the evaluation API; SGLang's generation and administration routes remain on
localhost and aren't forwarded publicly.

## How inference works

1. Validate the schema, answer count, body size, context length, and total token budget.
2. Render the native chat template **once**, with thinking disabled. Split out a
   common prefix and independently tokenize each question suffix.
3. Send the common prefix to `/generate` with `max_new_tokens=1`, await completion,
   and discard the sampled token. This warms SGLang's radix cache.
4. Concurrently send `prefix + question suffix + assistant header + "Answer:\n"`
   for each question. Every call again has **`max_new_tokens=1`**. Request
   `token_ids_logprob` for every answer label and `logprob_start_len=-1`, so there
   is no need to recompute prompt logprobs. The sampled token itself is ignored.
5. Renormalize the requested label logprobs with stable softmax. Noul returns
   `P(yes)`, Choice returns the argmax and full distribution, and Score returns
   `sum(level_index * probability)` with zero-based levels and a legend.

Options are rendered as `A: description`, `B: description`, etc., without JSON
wrappers. Choice keys identify response fields and are hidden from the model,
except when a description is `null`: then the option key supplies its meaning,
matching Jev's nullable description schema.

This is a prefill plus first-token-readout workload: there is no generated chain
of thought and no autoregressive continuation after the first token. There are
**N+1 one-token calls for N questions**, including the cache-warming call.
Speculative decoding is not enabled.

Qwen tokenizes `10` and `64` as multiple tokens. Answer labels are therefore
`A`–`Z`, followed by verified single-token letter combinations (`AA`, `AB`, ...).
All 64 labels are checked against the actual tokenizer at startup. Your original
option names are preserved in the returned distribution. This keeps 64-way
classification an exact one-token readout instead of comparing only the first
digit of a multi-token number.

Radix reuse is opportunistic, not a pinned per-request KV session. Hybrid Qwen's
recurrent state, cache page boundaries, cache pressure, and concurrent requests
can reduce hits. The backend uses `--mamba-radix-cache-strategy extra_buffer`.
`x-openjev-prefix-tokens` exposes the requested common prefix size. When SGLang
reports cache counts, `x-openjev-cached-tokens` sums the branch cache hits. SGLang
0.5.19's Rust frontend omits these counts: the header is absent and smoke reports
`null`, rather than a misleading zero. Scheduler logs still show actual cache
hits (verified on the live B200 deployment). `Server-Timing` separates
prompt preparation, the shared prefill, and branch inference.

`usage.input_tokens` sums SGLang's full prompt counts across the warm-up and all
branches, including cached tokens. `usage.output_tokens` is N+1. These are backend
usage counts, not TypeSafe billing estimates or unique tokens actually computed.

## Limits and configuration

Defaults are **64 questions**, **2–64 answers per Choice/Score**, **2 MiB JSON**,
**32,768 tokens per branch including its output**, **262,144 total submitted input
tokens**, **16 simultaneous evaluations**, and **64 simultaneous backend calls**.
Invalid requests return 422 before inference; oversized bodies return 413;
overload returns 529 with `Retry-After`. Backend timeouts return 504. Failed or
cancelled evaluations cancel sibling requests and attempt to abort them in SGLang.

All settings can be provided as `OPENJEV_*` environment variables; see
`src/openjev/config.py`. Common settings:

| Variable                          | Default                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENJEV_MODEL`                   | `nvidia/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4`                          |
| `OPENJEV_SERVED_MODEL_NAME`       | `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` (profile-specific public name)   |
| `OPENJEV_REVISION`                | Pinned NVIDIA checkpoint revision for the default model |
| `OPENJEV_FRONTEND`                | `rust` (`python` is an explicit fallback)               |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`        | `32768`                                                 |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_TOTAL_INPUT_TOKENS`  | `262144`                                                |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | `16`                                                    |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_CONCURRENT_BRANCHES` | `64`                                                    |
| `OPENJEV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`         | `120` seconds                                           |
| `OPENJEV_TEMPERATURE`             | `1.0`, applied during label normalization               |
| `OPENJEV_API_KEY`                 | Unset; optional Bearer authentication for the API       |
| `OPENJEV_BACKEND_API_KEY`         | Unset; optional separate SGLang Bearer key              |

The Modal launch script forwards `OPENJEV_PROFILE`, `OPENJEV_FRONTEND`, and
`OPENJEV_SERVED_MODEL_NAME` from the local environment. To customize other remote settings,
add them to `image.env(...)` or use a Modal Secret for keys. The Modal deployment requires
proxy authentication by default so unauthorized requests cannot wake a billable container.

OpenJev defines
`confidence = 1 - H(probabilities) / log(number_of_options)`, clamped to [0, 1].
This is zero for a uniform distribution and one for a point mass. Probabilities
are conditioned on the supplied options, depend on prompt and label ordering,
and are not calibrated estimates of correctness.
